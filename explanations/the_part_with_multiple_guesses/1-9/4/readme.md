# Question 4
## Question
After this loop has finished, what is the value of i?
```java
int i = 0;
while (i < 8) {
	System.out.print(i);
	i += 1;
}
```
a) 6  
b) 7  
c) 8  
d) 9  
e) 0  
## Answer
Again, it helps to visualize each step of the loop.

0. `i = 0`  
Is `i < 8`?
Yes, print i and continue loop.  
1. `i = 1`  
Is `i < 8`?
Yes, print i and continue loop.  
2. `i = 2`  
Is `i < 8`?
Yes, print i and continue loop.  
3. `i = 3`  
Is `i < 8`?
Yes, print i and continue loop.  
4. `i = 4`  
Is `i < 8`?
Yes, print i and continue loop.  
5. `i = 5`  
Is `i < 8`?
Yes, print i and continue loop.  
6. `i = 6`  
Is `i < 8`?
Yes, print i and continue loop.  
7. `i = 7`  
Is `i < 8`?
Yes, print i and continue loop.  
8. `i = 8`  
Is `i < 8`?
No, stop loop, code block has finished execution.

The final value of `i` is 8.
